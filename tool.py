def apply_dynamic_stylesheet(app, window, base_resolution=(1920, 1080)):
    """
    Apply a dynamic stylesheet to the application based on the screen resolution
    where the main window is currently displayed.

    This function adjusts the application's stylesheet and font size dynamically
    to ensure proper scaling on different screen resolutions. It also optionally
    resizes the main window based on the calculated scale factor.

    Args:
        app (QApplication): The main application instance.
        window (QMainWindow): The main application window.
        base_resolution (tuple): The base resolution (width, height) used as a reference
                                 for scaling. Defaults to (1920, 1080).

    Steps:
        1. Determine the current screen's resolution.
        2. Calculate a scale factor based on the ratio of the current resolution
           to the base resolution.
        3. Adjust the global font size using the scale factor.
        4. Load and scale the application's stylesheet properties (e.g., font-size,
           padding, margin, etc.) using the scale factor.
        5. Apply the scaled stylesheet to the application.
        6. Optionally resize the main window based on the scale factor.

    Notes:
        - The function expects a stylesheet file named "style.qss" to be present
          in the working directory.
        - If the stylesheet file cannot be opened, the function will print an error
          message and exit without applying any changes.

    Example:
        apply_dynamic_stylesheet(app, main_window)
    """
    # Determine the current screen

    # Calculate scale factor
    scale_factor = min(width / base_resolution[0], height / base_resolution[1])
    
    # Set global font size

                - Add the new component to the selected assembly in the `complete_structure`.
